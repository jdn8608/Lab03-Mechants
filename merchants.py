"""
CSAPX Lab 3: Merchants of Venice

This program will read in a list of Merchants and created tuples of these Merchants.
Then depending on the determined runtime in the call of this program from the command line, the program will
run algorithms to find the median value of the list of merchants. This median merchant is the optimal location
that minimizes the distance travel to other locations.
